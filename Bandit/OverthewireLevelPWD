	This one was tricky. Essentially the key was learning the "sort -u" which makes sure the list is alphabetically
	sorted and grouped, allowing the filter unique command to work. Then, with the shortened list we run "uniq -u" 
	which checks each line by its previous line (limited to only the line before it) to pull out unique line

	Remember, this problem used "strings" which is useful for reading any data files (not .txt) for 
	human-readable characters
